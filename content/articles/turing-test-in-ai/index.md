## Introduction
The Turing Test in AI(Artificial Intelligence) is a method that is used to test the intelligence of a machine by making inquiries. It tries to test whether a machine is able to think like a human. The test uses three parties in its performance, a human, computer and an interrogator.

### History of Turing Test in AI

Turing Test as the name suggests  was introduced by Alan Turing in the year 1950 in his article 'computing machinery',  and it aimed at testing whether a machine can think.
The test is based on a party game called the imitation game with its modifications and it involves three players a computer, human respondent and a human interrogator.The interrogator does the inquiry  while the human and the computer are to respond to the interrogator. The intercrogator is usually isolated from the other players for the purpose of identifying which among them is a machine.The players are allocated some unique characters as unique identifiers in their different locations.The interrogator already know that one of the players is a machine but it only needs a justification based on making some inquiries and acquiring responses.
Given that one of the players is a machine and its ability to convert text to speech in form of bits  0 and 1, the conversation is done using a screen and keyboard.The results of the test on the machine is based on the close responses like the human answer.

The interrogator might ask question like.

__Interrogator__ : *Are you a man?*

__Player x (*computer*)__ : *NO*

__Interrogator__ : _Convert the folowwing binary digit  into bits (4294967296)_

**Player X** : *Pauses for a while and gives the wrong answer.*

This game considers the computer to have passed the test successfully hence intelligent if the interrogator would not distinguish between the human and the machine.

 Research conducted shows that to date no machine has passed the turing test.

### The performance of Turing Test 
The Turing Test is performed under an imterrogation. The human respondent and the machine are made invisible .The test identifies a machine as intelligent if it is unable to distinguish between the computer  and the human then it concludes has passed the test successfully and therefore considering intelligent. in other words the machine can think possessing the characteristic of a human.

According to this test a machine is considered intelligent if it  is unable to distinguish between the human respondent  and the computer.

### Requirements for passing Turing Test in AI 
A machine is considered to have successfuly passed the turing test if it is able to meet the following requirements :
 1. ___Natural language processing (NLP)___: It can understand natural human languages.

 2. ___Knowledge representation(KR)___: To store and retrieve information provided before or during the interrogation.

 3. ___Automated reasoning(AR)___:This requires that a machine is able to use the stored information to answer questions and make new conclusions.
 
 4. ___Machine learning___: This is needed to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

 5. ___Vision___: Vision to recognize the examiners actions and varrious objects represented by the examiner.

 6. ___Motor control___: To act upon object as required.

 7. ___Other senses___: such such as audition, smell, touch etc.

 ### *Features of a Turing Test*
 Turing Test requires the following : 

1. __Participant__
    - an interrogation room
    - a person
    - computer

2. **The site** ;
 where the test itself takes place and the where the particpiants are kept in separate places.
3. __The test__ ; The test is made by asking questions.  


 ### Limitations of Turing test 
- The test is requires physical interaction which necessitates the need of perception and actuation.

-  The test is not reproducible. It uses different code or logic from the original.
modern day Turing Test 
the test aimed at upgrading Alan's Turing Test in order analyse the progress of Natural language processing.The test aims at creating Artificial Intelligent agents that can communuicate using different modes. 

- Turing test may not be a necessary test for testing the level of intelligence of a machine since it is not fully quaranteed that any machine that can imitate an intelligent behaviour is intelligent.

- It cannot be performed in an open place since one of its requirement is that the players should be in separate rooms to ensure they are hidden from view.

- The test is limited to only testing human like intelligence.


### Conclusion
Turing Test is an important test in the measure of a machine's intelligence to depict its ability of displaying human like characteristics of thought.
